<h2><em>Introduction</em><h2>
Fit for work is an ecommerce website that offers consumers workout plans that are tailored to suit their occupation.

<h2><em>Business model:</em></h2>
Currently business to consumer but will transition to business to business(gym/personal trainers/fitness influencers/athletes/chefs) once the website has gained enough traction. This will all be done via my company, 'Pendulum to Paper Production Limited', which is a limited company registered with the Companies Registration Office in the Republic of Ireland.


SEO:
-I included meta tags for description and keywords within the base.html code. I ensured to include researched long-tail and short-tail keywords.
Words used on code
Use of non rel tags
Inclusion of site.xml file and robots.txt. file.
Robots.txt file will denote what sections of the website should be ignored when the google spiders crawl the website to decide on where it should place withint the google pages on search result.

Inclusion of privacy policy-as inferred in the tutorials, this increases the credibility/legitimacy of the websote.

Key words employed-strove to achieve a balance between short tail and long tail keywords.


<h2><em>Marketing strategy:</em></h2>
Target Audience:
Very expansive-not a limited target audience.
People who believe that their job/work schedule is rpesenting a barrier to their fitness. People who want assistance in achieving their desired level of work life balance. People who need to make time somewhere.
Wide range of goals: Weight loss, muscle gain, general fitness, purely aesthetic.
Job types designed to be all encompasssing: Sedentary, mobile, work from home, retired, unemployed.
Range of prices based on tier 100-500, expands target audience. Different offerings and different timescales offered wiht each tier.



<em>Facebook business profile:</em>
Link: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=113155328477784&set=a.113155365144447
What is the purpose of this/what does it add to the marketing of the website?: Posts moderated by admin of website. Comments and reviews allowed. Facebook is an excellent marketing tool as it has huge presence and reach.
Af effective visual tool to attract new consumers is to have 'Before' and 'After' comparative posts which include photos. These demonstrate success stories and as the occupation is stipulated, it might offer an avenue to people who thought a workout plan simlpy could not be provided for their type of job. Evidence based promotion.
Organic, offer talks and explanations at gyms and local sports clubs.
<em>Nutrition newsletter</em>
I have included a mailchimp embedded sign-up form for consumers to sign up to receive the nutrition newsletter: Nutrition newsletter sent fortnightly. An effort will be made to keep this relevant and engaging to retain the interest of the consumer and to also nudge people in the direction of signing up for a nutrition plan offering that will be offered soon. Company updates and links to socials will also be included on this newsletter.

Paid: External from course but as I hope to continue to develop this, I will ensure to enlist the following google services to monitor, track and manage the website and related apps and profiles:


<b>Google business</b>
Upon reviewing the tutorials, I registered business with google.
One of the reasons for this is it improves search engine ranking for SEO key words.
Potential consumers are more likely to trust a registered business.
Registration for Google Business was free.
There are various other potential positvies of this:
Alerts for user interactions
Detailed analytics provided...clicks, visits to profiles etc.
Updates in real time
Flag process available for images/comments uploaded by visitors

![alt text](.//media/)

Other avenues that I will be investing in in the future are google ads and google analytics. I did not invest in these for the purposes of the project to avoid getting involved in any GDPR related issues.

 I also will monitor and manage the user interaction with the site using hotjar and facebook pexel as promoted on the tutorials.

GDPR consent form required to sign up for google analytics.
Toughest privacy and security policy in the world.
Many privacy and security standards don't apply to developers.
Website:
https://gdpr.eu/

Additionally, I generated a privacy policy for 'Fit For Work' at the following website:

https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/

Text webpage was provided for the Fit For Work app, informing users about how their data is being collected and processed.
Concise, transparent, easily accessible.


GDPR: I will pay close heed to GDPR, ensure that all facebok posts that detail the experiences of consumers are consent based. I will ensure all consent boxes are not ticked automatically as this would be a breach of GDPR.



<b>User Experience (UX)</b>
 
 I created a kanban board on github, outlining important user story. I labelled them according to MOSCOW prioritisation and ensured that less than 60% of the stories were must haves.

<b>User requirements</b>
Fitness and health
Exercises 
Plans
Ecommerce-ability to pay for something

Ensured that no more than 60% of user stories were labelled as 'must haves' as per advice from the tutorials.

Themes- The user stories could be packaged within the following themes:

Registration and login
Viewing and choosing plans
Viewing techniques
Learning about the founder
Accessing facebook profile
Signing up for the newsletter
Purchasing plans


Milestones:
Noted the milestone feature available on github, to focus on completing various user stories in a certain timeframe. Did not complete this.

Sprints

<b>Design</b>
<b>Colour Scheme</b>
The main colours used for Fit4Work: teal, fuschia, black and white.

 I used fuschia and the hover effect to make certain items pop.

Employed AdobeColour to refine the teal colours to be used on the website:
https://color.adobe.com/search?q=teal#

Used colorpalette to decide on the colors.
Wanted something stark and contrasting but not grating (teal on white)
Wanted something relatively formal to fit in with the occupation based theme (black and white)


Work/occupation...background image chosen inkeeping with the occupation absed theme. A man in a suit witha. briefcase, climbing the stairs. Professional yet active.

<b>Logo</b>
Invested in a once off logo as came across the website, 'Looka' when researching for the project on the peer code review page...credit roman

  I chose teal and stipulated that the website was fitness related and I have included the logo as an image beside the name in the header of the landing page and also as the favicon.


<b>Typography</b>
The XX font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Why I chose this font for Fit4Work: XX is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate...vivid, sharp, fitness, new, fresh...related to professionalism and occupation

<b>Imagery</b>
Imagery is important. The XX image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention and is in-keeping with the theme of fitness and nutrition influenced/adjusted to suit the occupation of the user. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

Please see below images chosen for job type and reason why:
Please see below images chose for techniques and reason why:
Please see below image chosen for nutrition newsletter:


<b>Socials</b>
Facebook business profile
Before/After photos...design/divided out by occupation
Motto-'If I can do it, so can you.' 'I'm a XX and look at me!'

<b>Wireframes</b>

Used lucidcharts as a foundation for planning.

Numerous tabs used, to write along with the tutorials and break down code as this helps me to solidify/undertsand what is going on and impacts my overall planning.

As I continued to grow an understanding of django and full stack frameworks, I added tabs to help me to understand.

Visual aspect helped me to solidify my understanding:

Enity Relationship Diagram:

I created an ERD for the models, specifiying the field and how the mdoels related to one another.
One to one relationship versus many to one or one to many.

One-to-one 
Many-to-any

Deciding on fields to include in the models.
(CharField/TextField/IntegerFieldetc)

Landing Page Wireframe - View

Mobile Wireframe - View

Techniques Page Wireframe - View

Different views...

On sale currently -exercise plans based on occupation. Consumer chooses based on tier and technique.

How are meal plans laid out
Will there be a photo element
Free descriptions of meal plans
Vs
Detailed, tailored meal plans with details on protein content, fibre content, calories and estimate macros

Landing page/Home page view...
What will be here?
The whole concept is how work shapes our lives and how we must adapt to the shape

Dropdown filter based on professiom?
Background theme?
Font awesome?

Medical/Teaching/Artist (stethescope, ruler, canvas)
Work from home/work from office/work from vehicle (bus/train/plane)
(Representative photos for each...person sitting up in bed for work from home, office chair for office, moving bus for vehicle)
Shift work/fixed office hours (font awesome of clock...mini calendar with 9-5 5 days blocked and a separate mini calendar with random dots)
Variable annual leave/No annual leave 
Sedentary/Mobile work (Photo of a chair, photo of moving person)

Dropdowns...offering is plans based on occupation type (Sedentary etc.) Consumer chooses these as well as other preferences
goal (weight loss, muscle gain, general fitness), level (three different tiers, tier 1,2,3) and technique (eight different approaches available)

<b>Technologies Used</b>

<b>Languages Used</b>

<b>Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used</b>
Django

<b>Bootstrap 4.4.1:</b>...is this the correct version of Bootstrap?
Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
I liked materialise also but noted in the tutorials, it was recommended not to use both frameworks simultaneously and bootstrap used as boilerplate code-stuck with bootstrap.

<i>Hover.css:</i>
Hover.css was used on the **Social Media icons** in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.

<i>Google Fonts:</i>
Google fonts were used to import the 'XX' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<i>Font Awesome:</i>
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
Bulma used to ensure icons consistently aligned on all pages of the website-as per tutorials.

<i>jQuery:</i>
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

<i>Git</i>
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

<i>GitHub:</i>
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

<i>Lucidcharts:</i>
Lucidcharts was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

I found Lucicharts preferable to balsamiq due to the tabular format so I could compartmentalise elements of the design process myself and apply the pomodoro technique to each segment (focussing for 25minutes on each segment) even in the planning phase. Also, I am a very visual person so the element of shapes, tabs and clear 1-2-3 continuing visual structure assisted me in formulating the design.

<b>Testing</b>

BDD-TDD

Jest...install jest
JQuery...screengrabs of JQuery tests

As part of tutorials, we learned how to build based on tests TDD but not required for this project

Python testing, Unittest library in python:

Did I write any testing functions?


The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

Include validators for other languages (Javascript/Python)...Also what about Flake8?

<i>W3C Markup Validator - Results</i>

Gives a list of all of the issues in the code so we can go through these one by one
control and click on line, takes you to line - code style and linting issues. Tells you
whee you have imported something and not used it


<i>Written tests - Results</i>

As per tutorials...

Types of tests

Written before the code

To ensure the tests were readable and easy to interpret and understand by other developers, I added specific tabs for each of the segments. These were called ''

I included the main tests for each of these segments, what I considered to be the most important tests...

<b>Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section</b>
<i>First Time Visitor Goals</i>
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a logo image with Text and a "" Call to action button.

The main points are made immediately with the work/fitness image

The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page. (What about the footer?)

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are. This links to the facebook business profile page where client before/after photos and testimonials can be viewed.

Once the new visitor has read the 'Workout to suit your Work' text, they will notice the 'Plan descriptions' section.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer. (is the footer absolute...what is contained in the footer. Importance of the footer article)

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

<i>Returning Visitor Goals</i>
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the targeted fitness and nutrition plans.

These are clearly shown in the banner message.
They will be directed to a page with another fitness image and call to action.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have (progressive overload)

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

<b>Frequent User Goals</b>
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.
As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

<b>Further Testing</b>
<b>Browser based testing</b>
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
<b>Device based testing</b>
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX. (Developer tools)

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

<b>Known Bugs</b>
On some mobile devices the Work pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

<b>How bugs were resolved</b>

-Issue with AWS...getting active keys...consulted with people on slack. There was an additional step to set up the active keys:
Screenshot:

-Webhooks issue with Stripe...worked on safari...

-Database caching issue
