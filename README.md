<h2><em>Introduction</em><h2>
Fit for work is an ecommerce website that offers consumers workout plans that are tailored to suit their occupation.
It employs eight different Japanese techniques that are detailed on the website int he approach taken to the design of 
the tailored workout plans. Consumers can choose their plan based on occupation type, technique to be used in the approach, their goal for the workout plan (weight loss/muscle gain/general fitness) and the tier that they want to select (there are three different tiers that differ in what will be provided with the plan and the lenth of time support will be available for.) Consumers can purchase these plans online using their credit card. They can also sign up to the facebook business profile which is linked throughout the site. They can also opt into subscribing for the nutrition newsletter which is a free subscription service, wherein a newsletter with nutrition tips and details on supplements is sent to their personal email each month.

<h2><em>Business model:</em></h2>
Currently the business is a business to consumer(B2C) structure but it will eventually evolve to include business to business services as well (with gyms/personal trainers/fitness influencers/athletes/chefs). This transition will be put into effect once the website has gained enough traction. 

 The Fit For Work app is in affiliation with my company, 'Pendulum to Paper Production Limited', which is a limited company registered with the Companies Registration Office in the Republic of Ireland.


<b>SEO:</b>
-I included meta tags for description and keywords within the base.html code. I ensured to include researched long-tail and short-tail keywords within the base.html meta tags block code.
Words used on code
Use of non rel tags...for links that are not relevant or should not be considered when assessing the SEO of the website.

<b>Inclusion of site.xml file and robots.txt. file.</b>

<p>Robots.txt file will denote what sections of the website should be ignored when the google spiders crawl the website to decide on where it should place withint the google pages on search result.</p>

<b>Inclusion of privacy policy</b>
<p>As inferred in the tutorials, this increases the credibility/legitimacy of the website.</p>

<h2><em>Marketing strategy:</em></h2>
<b>Target Audience:</b>
Very expansive-not a limited target audience. The fact that it ties occupation and fitness together is inclusive as opposed to exclusive. Everybody has a job (there are also plans available for the retired and unemployed even if they don't). Our occupation as the name suggests occupies us for most of our lives and, accordingly will have a pervasive impact on our health and fitness. This is why occupation is the primacy lense through which the plans are designed. This way work can no longer be used as an excuse for avoiding addressing your fitness and health. We ensure that your work is not a barrier to fitness by making the workouts complimentary/designed to align with your occupation.

 The plans are especially suitable for people who believe that their job/work schedule is presenting a barrier to their fitness. The workout plans offered are ideal for people who want assistance in achieving their desired level of work life balance. The team at Fit For Work will help consumers to carve out time where they previously believed that there was none.

Wide range of goals: Weight loss, muscle gain, general fitness, purely aesthetic.
Job types designed to be all encompassing (not limiting): Sedentary, mobile, work from home, retired, unemployed.
Range of prices based on the tier that the consumer chooses (ranging from 100e-500e), expands target audience. A different level of time commitment and intensity is expected for each of the tiers, as further described on the app.


<em>Facebook business profile:</em>
Link: https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=113155328477784&set=a.113155365144447
<p>What is the purpose of this/what does it add to the marketing of the website?: Posts moderated by admin of website. Comments and reviews allowed. Facebook is an excellent marketing tool as it has huge presence and reach.
Af effective visual tool to attract new consumers is to have 'Before' and 'After' comparative posts which include photos. These demonstrate success stories and as the occupation is stipulated, it might offer an avenue to people who thought a workout plan simlpy could not be provided for their type of job. Evidence based promotion.
Organic, offer talks and explanations at gyms and local sports clubs.</p>

<em>Nutrition newsletter</em>
<p>I have included a mailchimp embedded sign-up form for consumers to sign up to receive the nutrition newsletter: Nutrition newsletter sent fortnightly. An effort will be made to keep this relevant and engaging to retain the interest of the consumer and to also nudge people in the direction of signing up for a nutrition plan offering that will be offered soon. Company updates and links to socials will also be included on this newsletter.

A sample newsletter is provided in the tab so that consumers can peruse it with a view to deciding whether they would like to subscribe.
</p>

<h1>Other paid avenues to pursue in managing the FFW App.</h1>

<p>External from course but as I hope to continue to develop this, I will ensure to enlist the following google services to monitor, track and manage the website and related apps and profiles:
<ol>
<li>Google business</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Google Adwords</li>
<li>HotJar</li>
<li>Facebook Pexel</li>
</ol>

<b>Google business</b>
<p>Upon reviewing the tutorials, I registered business with google.
One of the reasons for this is it improves search engine ranking for SEO key words.
Potential consumers are more likely to trust a registered business.
Registration for Google Business was free.
There are various other potential <em>positives</em> of this:
Alerts for user interactions
Detailed analytics could be provided...clicks, visits to profiles etc.
Updates provided in real time
There is flag process available for images/comments uploaded by visitors.
I didn't become to deeply involved with this in terms of analysis for project submission stage, to avoid
GDPR related issues.</p>

<section>Screenshot:

![alt text](.//media/ffw_google_business.png)
</section>

Other avenues that I will be investing in in the future are google ads and google analytics. I did not invest in these for the purposes of the project to avoid getting involved in any GDPR related issues.

 I also will monitor and manage the user interaction with the site using hotjar and facebook pexel as promoted on the tutorials.

GDPR consent form required to sign up for google analytics.
Toughest privacy and security policy in the world.
Many privacy and security standards don't apply to developers.
Website:
https://gdpr.eu/

Additionally, I generated a privacy policy for 'Fit For Work' at the following website:

https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/

Text webpage was provided for the Fit For Work app, informing users about how their data is being collected and processed.
Concise, transparent, easily accessible.


GDPR: I will pay close heed to GDPR, ensure that all facebok posts that detail the experiences of consumers are consent based. I will ensure all consent boxes are not ticked automatically as this would be a breach of GDPR.



<b>User Experience (UX)</b>
 
 I created a kanban board on github, outlining important user story. I labelled them according to MOSCOW prioritisation and ensured that less than 60% of the stories were must haves.

<b>User requirements</b>
The things that I considered when assessing user requirements in terms of business plan:
<ul>
<li>Fitness and health</li>
<li>Exercises</li> 
<li>Plans</li>
<li>Ecommerce-ability to pay for something</li>
<li>Support throughout fitness journey</li>
<li>Evidence provided for success of following such plans in the past</li>
<li>Can view testimonials by individuals in similar circumstances...same job type</li>
<li>Ability to review experience</li>
<li>Trial period</li>
<li>Probably something on nutrition</li>
</ul>

<b>User stories</b>
Kanban Board-link:

<b>Prioritisation</b?>
I incorporated MOSCOW prioritisation incorporated in terms of the user stories.
Labels were used effectively in the kanban board structure:
Must Have (Colour: Green):
Screengrab:

Should Have (Colour: XX):
Screengrab:

Could Have (Colour: XX):
Screengrab:

Won't have (Colour: Red):
Screengrab:


Ensured that no more than 60% of user stories were labelled as 'must haves' as per advice from the tutorials.

Themes- The user stories could be packaged within the following themes:
<ol>
<li>Registration and login</li>
<li>Viewing and choosing plans</li>
<li>Viewing techniques</li>
<li>Learning about the founder, the company, the eudcation and qualifications behind the plan</li>
<li>Accessing the facebook business profile and seeing reviews/testimonials/posts of other consumers</li>
<li>Signing up for the newsletter</li>
<li>Purchasing plans</li>
</ol>

<em>Milestones:</em>
Noted the milestone feature available on github, to focus on completing various user stories in a certain timeframe. Did not complete this.

I had fully intended to create milestones for particular iterations of the user stories but unfortunately, I was too anxious to do so and did not put this into action.

<em>Sprints</em>
Allocated amounts of time to set smaller goals-this certainly would have alleviated my anxiety and I will ensure to put this into effect for future projects.

<b>Design</b>
<b>Colour Scheme</b>
The main colours used for Fit4Work: teal, fuschia, black and white.

 I used fuschia and the hover effect to make certain items pop.

Employed AdobeColour to refine the teal colours to be used on the website:
https://color.adobe.com/search?q=teal#

Used colorpalette to decide on the colors.
Wanted something stark and contrasting but not grating (teal on white)
Wanted something relatively formal to fit in with the occupation based theme (black and white)
The UI still felt flat after incorporating the above colours so I applied the stark and revitalising fuschia colour
to make certain items pop and so that the UI would not appear too mundane.


Work/occupation...background image chosen inkeeping with the occupation absed theme. A man in a suit with a briefcase, climbing the stairs. Professional yet active.

<b>Logo</b>
Having reviewed other students repositaries via the peer-code-reveiw section of Slack, I noted that 
others were investing in logos on the website Looka and as I felt there was an option for a once off subscription without purchase and I felt that the logo, which could be used on the landing page as well as in the favicon added hugely to the UI, I purchased a logo for Fit For Work that was inkeeping with the teal and balck theme of the website.

  I chose teal and stipulated that the website was fitness related and I have included the logo as an image beside the name in the header of the landing page and also as the favicon.

![alt text](.//media/FFW%20logo.png)

<b>Typography</b>
The San-Serif font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Why I chose this font for Fit4Work: XX is vivid, sharp and I felt that it was in-keeping with the theme of professionalism and occupation.

<b>Imagery</b>
Imagery is important. The XX image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention and is in-keeping with the theme of fitness and nutrition influenced/adjusted to suit the occupation of the user. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

Please see below images chosen for job type and reason why:

Please see below images chose for techniques and reason why:


Please see below image chosen for nutrition newsletter:
  I felt that the sandwich with the measurement device on it perfectly encaptured what the nutrition newsletter was trying 
  to put into effect. Eat wholesome, tasty foods but be calculating and precise in your tracking.


<b>Socials</b>
<b>Facebook business profile</b>
 
Before/After photos...design/divided out by occupation
Motto-'If I can do it, so can you.' 'I'm a XX and look at me!'


<i> Wireframes and Lucidcharts:</i>
Lucidcharts was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

I found Lucicharts preferable to balsamiq due to the tabular format so I could compartmentalise elements of the design process myself and apply the pomodoro technique to each segment (focussing for specific time periods on each segment) even in the planning phase. Also, I am a very visual person so the element of shapes, tabs and clear 1-2-3 continuing visual structure assisted me in formulating the design.

 To cement my understanding of the process and tutorials, I wrote up wireframes and summaries of tutorials as i made my way thorugh, with a view to aiding my comprehension of the course and being able to establish what should be included in the project and what should not be included:

Screengrab of numerous planning tabs on Lucidcharts:
1: ![alt text](./media/)
2: ![alt text](./media/)c
3: ![alt text](./media/)
4: ![alt text](./media/)
5: ![alt text](./media/)

Numerous tabs used, to write along with the tutorials and break down code as this helps me to solidify/undertsand what is going on and impacts my overall planning.

As I continued to grow an understanding of django and full stack frameworks, I added tabs to help me to understand.

Visual aspect helped me to solidify my understanding:

Enity Relationship Diagram:

I created an ERD for the models, specifiying the field and how the mdoels related to one another.
One to one relationship versus many to one or one to many.

To cement my understanding of what ERD is and what the fields in a model mean, I replicated ERD's from tutorials in my own Lucidcharts:


One-to-one 
Many-to-any

Deciding on fields to include in the models.

HTML5 
CSS3
Javascript
Python

<b>Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used</b>
Django

<b>Bootstrap 4.4.1:</b>.
Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
I liked materialise also but noted in the tutorials, it was recommended not to use both frameworks simultaneously and bootstrap used as boilerplate code-stuck with bootstrap.

<i>Hover.css:</i>
Hover.css was used on the **Social Media icons** in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.

<i>Google Fonts:</i>
Google fonts were used to import the 'XX' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<i>Font Awesome:</i>
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
Bulma used to ensure icons consistently aligned on all pages of the website-as per tutorials.

<i>jQuery:</i>
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

<i>Git</i>
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
I tried to ensure my commit messages were always imperative.

<i>GitHub:</i>
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

<b>Testing</b>

Throughout the mtutorials for module five, we learned a lot about test driven development but it was specified also in the tutorials that this would not be expected for the project.

<em>Manual testing:</em>
I inserted specific text.py files in the Plans app. I inserted tests for the models and the views.


Python testing, Unittest library in python:


The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

<b>Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section</b>
<i>First Time Visitor Goals</i>
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a logo image with Text and a "" Call to action button.

The main points are made immediately with the work/fitness image

The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page. (What about the footer?)

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are. This links to the facebook business profile page where client before/after photos and testimonials can be viewed.

Once the new visitor has read the 'Workout to suit your Work' text, they will notice the 'Plan descriptions' section.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer. (is the footer absolute...what is contained in the footer. Importance of the footer article)

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

<i>Returning Visitor Goals</i>
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the targeted fitness and nutrition plans. I may have tried one of the plans and want to try another that differs in approach. Alternatively, I may want to try the same plan but at a more advanced tier (e.g. I may have purchased and completed a Tier 1 Pomodoro technique for a person working in a sedentary job with access to gym and equipment but I may now want to move on to a more advance plan, with the Tier 2 version or tier 3 version.)

These are clearly shown in the banner message.
They will be directed to a page with another fitness image and call to action.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have (progressive overload). This can be done via the facebook business profile, where contact details are readily available. Also an email address and iframe/google business link to the business is provided on the founder page.

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Landing Page page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
 The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

<b>Frequent User Goals</b>
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added offers.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.
As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

<b>Further Testing</b>
<b>Browser based testing</b>
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
<b>Device based testing</b>
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX. (Developer tools)

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.
