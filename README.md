<b>Design</b>
<b>Colour Scheme</b>
The two main colours used for Fit4Work: red, and white.
Why did I pick these colours?

<b>Typography</b>
The XX font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Why I chose this font for Fit4Work: XX is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate...vivid, sharp, fitness, new, fresh...related to professionalism and occupation

<b>Imagery</b>
Imagery is important. The XX image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention and is in-keeping with the theme of fitness and nutrition influenced/adjusted to suit the occupation of the user. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

Before/After photos...design/divided out by occupation
Motto-'If I can do it, so can you.' 'I'm a XX and look at me!'

<b>Technologies Used</b>

<b>Languages Used</b>
HTML5

Javascript
Python

<b>Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used</b>
Django

<b>Bootstrap 4.4.1:</b>...is this the correct version of Bootstrap?
Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.
<i>Hover.css:</i>
Hover.css was used on the **Social Media icons** in the footer to add the float transition while being hovered over.

<i>Google Fonts:</i>
Google fonts were used to import the 'XX' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

<i>Font Awesome:</i>
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.

<i>jQuery:</i>
jQuery came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive but was also used for the smooth scroll function in JavaScript.

<i>Git</i>
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

<i>GitHub:</i>
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

**<i>Photoshop:</i>
Photoshop was used to create the logo, resizing images and editing photos for the website.**

<i>Lucidcharts:</i>
Lucidcharts was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

I found Lucicharts preferable to balsamiq due to the tabular format so I could compartmentalise elements of the design process myself and apply the pomodoro technique to each segment (focussing for 25minutes on each segment) even in the planning phase. Also, I am a very visual person so the element of shapes, tabs and clear 1-2-3 continuing visual structure assisted me in formulating the design.

<b>Testing</b>

BDD-TDD

Jest...install jest
JQuery...screengrabs of JQuery tests

As part of tutorials, we learned how to build based on tests TDD but not required for this project

Python testing, Unittest library in python:



The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

Include validators for other languages (Javascript/Python)...Also what about Flake8?

Types of tests

Written before the code

To ensure the tests were readable and easy to interpret and understand by other developers, I added specific tabs for each of the segments. These were called ''

I included the main tests for each of these segments, what I considered to be the most important tests...

<b>Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section</b>
<i>First Time Visitor Goals</i>
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Briefcase and Barbell image with Text and a "Fit4Werk" Call to action button.

The main points are made immediately with the work/fitness image

The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page. (What about the footer?)

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are. This links to the facebook business profile page where client before/after photos and testimonials can be viewed.

Once the new visitor has read the 'Workout to suit your Work' text, they will notice the 'Plan descriptions' section.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer. (is the footer absolute...what is contained in the footer. Importance of the footer article)

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

<i>Returning Visitor Goals</i>
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the targeted fitness and nutrition plans.

These are clearly shown in the banner message.
They will be directed to a page with another fitness image and call to action.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have (progressive overload)

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

<b>Frequent User Goals</b>
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.
As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link.
As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.

At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

<b>Further Testing</b>
<b>Browser based testing</b>
The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
<b>Device based testing</b>
The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX. (Developer tools)

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

<b>Known Bugs</b>
On some mobile devices the Work pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.
